            <p id="char-description">Mia Fey was a defense attorney known
                for her undying belief in her clients. She started out at
                 Grossberg Law Offices, then eventually created her own 
                 criminal defense law firm, Fey & Co. Law Offices. She 
                 was Phoenix Wright's boss and mentor, and she left her firm 
                 to him after her death at the hands of Redd White. Her 
                 younger sister Maya served as Wright's assistant during his
                  law career, and would sometimes use her spirit channeling 
                  abilities to allow Mia to assist Wright. </p>
